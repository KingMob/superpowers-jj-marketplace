# Superpowers Marketplace

Curated Claude Code plugins for skills, workflows, and productivity tools.

## Differences

This is a fork of obra's superpowers marketplace. Almost all credit should go to them.

The only difference is, I replaced the use of git in the superpowers plugin with Jujutsu (jj).

## Installation

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add KingMob/superpowers-jj-marketplace
```
